BROKEN:
1) Speaker Audio. (BT audio, HDMI audio and microphone works)
2) USB works when plugged in before boot. Will be fixed.
3) Battery icon.
4) Keyboard backlight and fn keys.
5) Intel Wifi doesnt work. There is some progress in getting it to work.

Important Note: You CAN NOT install directly to PM981. Create a VM and install macOS to a disk. Backup and restore the disk to PM981 and boot macOS.

Please note: This still work in progress. There are still few things that don't work properly. They will be fixed over time.

Please feel free to test stuff.
